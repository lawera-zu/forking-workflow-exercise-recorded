Ingredients

1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1 cup (240 ml) whole milk or 2%

5 apples peeled and thinly sliced or shredded
Powdered sugar for serving

Instructions
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
In another bowl, lightly beat the egg then add milk and oil. Add to dry ingredients and stir until smooth. Fold in the apples.
Pour batter using a ½ cup onto a lightly greased hot pan and spread to form a 5 inch circle. Turn when bubbles form. Cook the second side until golden brown and apples are tender. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.
Notes:

TIP: Typically, the apples must be cut into thin slices. Grated apples could work too.
